#Problem 3
#
#Write a function that computes the list of the 
#first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first 
#two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and 
#each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 
#
#As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 
#0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

def fibo(limit):
    
    array = [0, 1]
    
    while (len(array) < limit):
        array.append(array[len(array) - 2] + array[len(array) - 1])
        
    return array
    
print fibo(100)
